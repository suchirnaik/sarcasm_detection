 # Sarcasm Detection Project

## Overview

This project focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of machine learning and Transformer models for sarcasm detection in text. Sarcasm detection is a challenging natural language processing (NLP) task, and this project aims to explore different approaches and compare their performance.

## Goals

1. **Evaluate Machine Learning and Transformer Models**: We aim to assess the performance of various machine learning algorithms and Transformer models in detecting sarcasm in text data. By comparing the results, we can gain insights into the most effective models for this task.

2. **Comparison with Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Large Language Models, such as BERT, GPT-3, and others, have shown remarkable capabilities in various NLP tasks. In this project, we will compare the performance of LLMs with traditional machine learning approaches to understand their relative strengths and weaknesses in sarcasm detection.\

3. **Consideration of Features**: Sarcasm detection involves analyzing not only the text itself but also various contextual features. We will explore the impact of features such as sentiment analysis, word embeddings, user votes, and parent comments on the accuracy of sarcasm detection. These additional features can provide valuable context for improving model performance.\

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **Data Collection**: We collect a diverse dataset of text samples that include both sarcastic and non-sarcastic content.

- **Preprocessing**: Text data requires cleaning and preprocessing before being fed into models. This step includes tokenization, removing stop words, and other text data preparations.

- **Model Training**: We train various machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and others, as well as Transformer models like BERT, to perform sarcasm detection.

- **Feature Engineering**: We incorporate various features, such as sentiment analysis scores, word embeddings, user votes, and parent comments, into the models to enhance their performance.

- **Evaluation**: We evaluate the models based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix

- **Comparison**: We conduct a comprehensive comparison between different models and highlight their strengths and weaknesses.

- **Results**: The project's findings and results will be documented for future reference and insights.\
